# fark_proto.html — mechanics prototype ledger

Vehicle for the MASTER_PLAN phases. Save key `gambit4_proto`. index.html,
fark_nights.html, and _mockups untouched. New-system UI = bare black/white,
color accents only (family colours), system fonts.

## P0 — audit + scaffolding (done)

Brief §1 vs code:
- seats = pointsNeeded+2 ✓ (_nightSeats; extraSeat perk dies in P7)
- handicap: win=2 circles ✓ double gold ✓ loss rubs a circle ✓
- cap: highest tally ends ✓, dead-even → extra round ✓
- ADDED: trailing player final answer turn at cap (_handBackOrCap +
  endPTurn short-circuit, G._finalAnswerUsed). Sim harness cap loop does
  NOT model final answer yet — align in P8.

Old card system map (for P1 cutover):
- const CARDS at ~9348, 116 ids. Consumers: pCards ~204 refs, oCards ~122,
  activeCard ~88. Effect code is inline throughout scoring/turn/opp AI.
- Engine seams (line refs at P0): scoreRoll 10070, startPTurn 12456,
  endPTurn 14560, runOppTurn 14736, finOpp 15508, endMatch 16031,
  launchSeat 21711, generatePatron 9256, generateOppCards 19318.
- P1 strategy: build EV engine + FAM_CARDS beside old system; cut over
  offer/generation first, then delete old effect sites in one sweep;
  keep positional trio (vanguard/anchor/bookends) migrating into Vagabond.

## Decisions

- Proto keeps existing Room/match UI as scaffolding; new systems render
  as plain overlays/panels until the loop is proven.

## P1a — family card engine (done)

- Engine before scoreRoll: FAMILIES, FAM_CARDS (27 defs, brief copy
  verbatim), CFX effect hooks (renamed from FX — old particle system owns
  that name), famFire event bus, famGive() dev helper, famRow B&W chips.
- Seams wired: match init (G.pF/G.oF), startPTurn, _afterRollImpl,
  handleBank (bankBonus delta + bank event), doBust, finOpp opp bank,
  endPTurn (Falling Star extra turn).
- Live effects (unit-tested, 10/10 pass): slow_cook, insurance, retort
  (bust half), reprisal, pickpocket, falling_star, encore, double_or_nothing
  (armed-style: arm during turn, next bank flips — flow never pauses).
- Interpretations flagged: pickpocket lifts from opp TOTAL (brief says
  unbanked, which is empty at player bank time); sacrifice will bank its
  points (safe), not add to turn.
- Sim parity holds (40%/5 vs 45%/5 baseline, n=60 noise).

NEXT (P1b): draft v2 + run-start draft, loadout equip/sell panel,
remaining actives (transmute, powder_keg, sacrifice, ward, stargazer,
ill_omen, sleight, tar_pit, preserve, honeytrap, fools_gold), scoring-
internal passives (bloom, short_fuse, positional trio), then old-pool
offer cutover.

## P1b — old cards OFF, full family set live (done)

- Old pool retired: effectiveCards()->[], match init pCards=[], 
  generateOppCards()->[] (NPC cards return in P5). ~330 old effect sites
  now inert; physical deletion deferred (dead code, no behavior).
- Old rarity draft + boss signature draft replaced. Patron win -> greybox
  family draft (3 offers + DECLINE 5+night*5g). Boss win -> no draft
  (spoils in P4). Run start -> forced 1-of-3 tier-I draft overlay.
- Draft rules verified live: duplicate->upgrade-in-place (transmute I->II
  in play test), tier II raw only night 3+, III never raw, 60/40 family
  weighting (measured 218 vs ~28 per family).
- 24/27 cards live. Not live: cultivate (needs jade wilds, P2), tamper
  (needs visible opp cards, P5), for_keeps (P6).
- Greybox UI: famRow chips in match (tap actives; transmute uses prompt()
  for die+face), CARDS button on Room -> equip/satchel/sell panel,
  run-draft + win-draft overlays. All monochrome + family colour stripe.
- Interpretations: sleight/tar_pit/ill_omen are armed on your turn,
  resolve on the rival's next turn. Preserve stores a kept 1 or 5.
  Stargazer prints the omen as text (ghost dice later).

TEST CHECKLIST P1 (all pass): run draft, seat launch, famRow render,
slow-cook/insurance/retort/reprisal/pickpocket/falling-star/DoN unit
tests, win draft, upgrade path, decline gold, continue to Room, points
chalk, cap final-answer code path present.

NEXT (P2): dice v2 — mundane four + family dice defs, Brass/Crystal/Ruby
removal + refunds, shop rotation with SOLD slots, lucky dice on patrons,
jade wilds (enables cultivate + bloom fully).
