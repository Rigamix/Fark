# OPEN — questions and blockers

The only file you need to read. Everything has my recommendation, so **"yours"
is a valid answer.** Answered items are deleted, not marked — this stays short.

**Nothing blocks me right now.** §1 is a batch you have already ruled on and I
can start; §2–§4 need you or a playtest; §5 is a small cleanup question.

Rebuilt 2026-08-06 — it had reached 960 lines with four `CLOSED` sections still
in it, which defeated the point of the file. Deleted items live in git history.

## 1. THE RETUNE BATCH — ruled, ready to build, must land together

Three changes that all move difficulty. Ruled that they ship as **one measured
batch**, not three uncontrolled swings.

### 1a. The ladder is out of spec everywhere. Targets come down.

Every boss against the gear a player would genuinely hold that night, two
independent policies, a fresh loadout drawn per match.

| boss | night | carl | rita |
|---|---|---|---|
| GROG | 1 | 22.5 | 20.0 |
| MABEL | 2 | 32.5 | 32.0 |
| **FINNICK** | 3 | **65.0** | 64.0 |
| CORVUS | 4 | 23.0 | 23.0 |
| BRUTUS | 5 | 36.0 | 33.0 |
| **ALDRIC** | 6 | **11.0** | 12.0 |
| **WHISPER** | 7 | **9.5** | 7.5 |
| **AMBROSE** | 8 | **7.5** | 7.0 |

Target is 45–55%. **Seven below, one above, none inside.**

**Ruled: reductions concentrated and uneven, matching the shape** — nights 6–8
need by far the largest (they sit at a fifth to a third of target), nights 1–2
modest, night 3 none or a slight raise.

**And ruled honestly: targets alone probably cannot close a gap that size at
6–8 without making those matches trivial.** Likely needs targets down *and* some
player-scoring growth *and* §1c, working together rather than one lever doing
everything.

**Confidence bound:** nights 3–5 carry about **±10** of model-assumption
uncertainty — measured by re-running the whole table under the opposite spoils
assumption, not guessed. Nights 6–8 and 1–2 barely move between assumptions, so
their shape is safe to tune against. Do not tune a mid-ladder cell to a point
value.

### 1b. `challenge` is broken on the PLAYER side too

Law 6 has no stated exception here — a bug, to be closed on correctness grounds.
But it is also a difficulty change, and the ladder is already too hard
everywhere, so it lands **in this batch, measured with the rest**.

### 1c. `blessed_dice` / `crown_authority` say "reroll", the code wipes

The block un-keeps the rival's dice, sets `total=0`, and announces *"KEPT DICE
REROLLED!"* without re-rolling a single value. Build the real reroll; do not
reword the card.

**Correction to the original ruling, which assumed the wrong direction.** These
were taken to be boss cards punishing the player, and therefore a softening
lever for nights 7–8. They are not. There is **no NPC firing path at all** — the
only activations are `activateCrownAuthorityPlayer` / `activateBlessedDicePlayer`,
which arm it against the *rival*. So it is a **player weapon**, the wipe is
*stronger* than an honest reroll, and fixing it makes the game slightly
**harder** — which is exactly why it must be batched rather than shipped as
relief.

## 2. Early-game signal — needs a person, not more reasoning

Restoring the brief's 24 feats removed every feat that fires in a new player's
first hour. Ruled that nothing goes back into the feat list; the proposal is
that dialogue beats do that job instead. **No argument settles this — it needs a
playtest.**

---

## 3. `assets/` — an art-scope call on your timeline

47 live references into the previous game's tree have no replacement.

| group | count | style-mismatch risk |
|---|---|---|
| Character portraits | 9 | **highest** |
| Match frames | 8 | **highest** |
| Night_Art UI set | 10 | **highest** |
| Environment / menu | 9 | mixed |
| Fonts | 8 | lowest |
| Audio | 3 | lowest |

**If there is only room for a subset, it is the 27 in the high-risk rows.**

---

## 4. Unplayed numbers — flagged, not trusted

Last Call's 800 and most restored feat conditions read real state and render,
but only HIGH ROLLER has fired through a live match.

---

## 5. Tags describing a mechanic that does not exist

`blessed_dice` and `crown_authority` are tagged `npcOnly:true` with
`owner:'ambrose'` / `owner:'whisper'`, but **nothing ever makes a boss fire
them** — they exist only as player activations. Either the tags are wrong, or a
boss firing path was intended and never built.

**Not to be resolved by building the path** — that would be a further difficulty
increase on the two worst-off nights. My rec: treat the tags as the bug, drop
them, keep the cards as player spoils. Cheap either way, but it should be a
decision rather than a silent edit.

## Not blocking, for your awareness

- **Pages deploy is stuck behind a GitHub outage.** Actions and Pages both at
  `major_outage`, failing on `Invalid actions OIDC token`. Nothing fixable at
  our end. **Six commits are undeployed**, so the live site lacks combo, the
  hot-dice fix, the lane-integrity fix and Corvus's nerf. It will go out on the
  next push once they recover — verify with a marker grep, never a green build.
- **Four model assumptions remain untested** — 65% patron win rate, boss beaten
  first try, buys the dearest die in stock, no enchant/tavern gold. None *looks*
  load-bearing, but that is an impression rather than a measurement; the same
  sensitivity method settles any of them if a retune leans on one.
